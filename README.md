# StatWire
An IDE facilitating statistical analysis by providing a node editor
to enhance R.

Please note that this app was only tested with [Chrome] (v59).
Other browsers might cause issues.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI] version 1.1.3.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Install the following development tools:

1. [R]. (Note: Installing [RStudio] also installs R.)
2. [Node] and [npm]. (Note: Installing Node also installs npm.)
3. [Angular CLI]. (Note: Use `npm install -g @angular/cli` in the terminal.)

### StatLets
To install the app itself:

1. Install the app's dependencies, using `npm install`.
2. Install the [OpenCPU] R package in an R terminal, using
   `install.packages("opencpu")`.
3. Install the StatLets R package, found in `./R-package`, in an R terminal
   using `library(devtools); install()`.
   
   - Make sure the working directory is set to `./R-package`.
   - Reinstall StatLets's R package whenever it is changed
     (e.g., a new R function is added).

## Development server
Run `npm start` to launch a dev server as well as an OpenCPU server.
Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To only start the dev server you can use `npm statwire` or `ng serve`,
to only start the OpenCPU server you can use `npm opencpu`.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.
You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored
in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma].

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor].
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
